# Context for AI Assistant

## About Ankur

**Role**: Director of Engineering
**Coding Experience**: Strong software engineering background, but hasn't coded hands-on for ~2 years
**Current State**: Close to tech, reviews code with developers, understands systems thinking, but wants to get back to shipping code personally

**Learning Style**:
- Prefers to build world view first, then go deep
- Thrives on understanding the big picture before diving into details
- Learns best by building and shipping real projects

## What Ankur Wants to Achieve

### Primary Goal
**Get back to hands-on coding and start shipping projects end-to-end over the next 8 weeks**

### Specific Objectives
1. **Learn AI Engineering Path**: Vector databases, RAG, MCP, autonomous agents, non-deterministic systems
2. **Build Portfolio-Worthy Projects**: Each project should tell a story and demonstrate mastery
3. **Ship Weekly**: Real, production-ready projects, not just tutorials
4. **Create Content**: Blog posts, videos, portfolio website to showcase the journey
5. **Learn Modern AI Stack**: Embeddings, vector search, LLMs, agent frameworks, MCP servers

### Technology Preferences
- **Languages**: JavaScript and Python (comfortable with both)
- **AI Stack**: Vector DBs, RAG, MCP, agent systems
- **Tools**: Using Claude Code for development assistance
- **Approach**: Build from scratch first to understand, then use frameworks for comparison

## The Plan We Created

### 8-Week AI Engineering Journey
**Dates**: December 28, 2025 - February 22, 2026
**Total Time**: ~200 hours
**Story Arc**: "Building Production AI Systems: From Embeddings to Autonomous Agents"

### Weekly Breakdown
1. **Week 1** (Dec 28 - Jan 3, 2026): Foundations & Semantic Code Search - AGGRESSIVE (Holiday week, 40-50 hours)
2. **Week 2** (Jan 4-10, 2026): Personal Knowledge Base with Vector DBs
3. **Week 3** (Jan 11-17, 2026): Multi-Tenant Semantic Search SaaS

## How to Understand Progress

### Priority Order for Reading (When Resuming)
1. **CONTEXT.md** (this file) - Understand who Ankur is and what he's doing
2. **CURRENT_STATUS section below** - Where is he right now?
3. **week-XX/notes/daily-log.md** - What did he do most recently?
4. **PROGRESS.md** - Overall completion status
5. **week-XX/README.md** - Current week's detailed plan

### Progress Indicators
- **PROGRESS.md**: High-level weekly completion status, skills acquired, reflections
- **daily-log.md**: Granular daily updates - what was done, learned, challenges faced
- **Git commits**: Check `git log` for recent activity
- **Project folders**: Check `week-XX/project/` for actual code

### How Ankur Uses Claude Code
- **Scaffolding & Setup**: Claude helps with boilerplate and project setup
- **Debugging & Review**: Claude reviews code for best practices
- **Learning**: Claude explains concepts before Ankur implements
- **Testing & Docs**: Claude generates tests and documentation
- **BUT**: Ankur writes the core logic himself to learn deeply

## Key Principles for This Journey

### 1. Ship, Don't Perfect
- Focus on completing and shipping over perfection
- MVP first, iterate later
- Weekly deadlines are important

### 2. Build to Learn
- Don't just read tutorials - build real projects
- Understand fundamentals before using frameworks
- Write from scratch first, then compare with frameworks

### 3. Document Everything
- Daily logs capture learnings and challenges
- Blog posts force deep understanding
- Portfolio tells the complete story

### 4. World View First
- Week 1 starts with 2 days of reading and mental model building
- Understand the "why" and "how it fits together" before coding
- Create mental maps and diagrams

### 5. Portfolio-Worthy Output
- Each project should be production-ready
- Code is clean, tested, and well-documented
- Projects tell a coherent story: "From Director to AI Engineer"

## Important Context from Our Conversation

### Week 1 is Aggressive
- Ankur is on holiday, so Week 1 has 40-50 hour commitment
- This is the foundation week - crucial to get it right
- Focus: Understanding AI stack + shipping semantic code search tool

### Dates Were Fixed
- Originally had 2024 dates, corrected to 2025-2026
- Start: December 28, 2025 (Saturday)
- End: February 22, 2026

### The Story Arc Matters
**"From Engineering Leader to AI Practitioner: 8 Weeks of Building"**
- This isn't just learning - it's a career portfolio project
- Content creation is as important as the code
- Each week builds on the previous one

### Technologies He'll Learn
- **Vector DBs**: ChromaDB → Qdrant → Pinecone (progression)
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI, semantic search, similarity
- **RAG**: From scratch, then advanced patterns
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol servers
- **Agents**: ReAct pattern, tool calling, memory
- **Full Stack**: Next.js, FastAPI, deployment

# Current Status
**Last Updated**: December 28, 2025

## Where Ankur Is Now
- **Current Week**: Week 1
- **Current Day**: Day 1 (Saturday, Dec 28, 2025)
- **Current Task**: Ready to start foundational reading

## Today's Focus (Day 1-2 - Saturday-Sunday, Dec 28-29)
Follow this learning sequence - account for deep dives and rabbit holes:

1. [ ] **Claude Code Quickstart** (30 min) - https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart.md
2. [ ] **Stack Overflow: Intuitive Intro to Embeddings** (45 min - 1 hour) - https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/11/09/an-intuitive-introduction-to-text-embeddings/
3. [ ] **Jay Alammar's Illustrated Word2Vec** (30-45 min) - https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/
4. [ ] **Weaviate: Vector Embeddings Explained** (30-45 min) - https://weaviate.io/blog/vector-embeddings-explained
5. [ ] **Pinecone: Vector Database** (45 min - 1 hour) - https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/
6. [ ] **Andrej Karpathy's LLM Intro** (1.5 hours) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g
7. [ ] **Create mental model diagram** - Document in week-01/notes/mental-model.md (2-4 hours)

**Total**: 8-12 hours of focused learning (includes rabbit holes!)
**Learning Flow**: Tool mastery → Intuitive understanding → Visual learning → Technical depth → Big picture → Synthesis

**Note**: You learn by asking questions and going deep. Don't rush through. The rabbit holes are where real understanding happens.

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Ankur is using Claude Code as his development partner
- All code goes in `week-XX/project/` folders
- Update this CONTEXT.md at end of each day/session
- Blog posts go in `portfolio/blog-posts/`
- Daily logs are critical for continuity

## Last Session Summary
**What We Discussed**:
1. Ankur's background as Director of Engineering wanting to code again
2. His learning style: world view first, then deep dive
3. Goal: 8-week AI engineering journey with portfolio
4. Created complete folder structure and detailed plans
5. Week 1 is aggressive (holiday week, 40-50 hours)
6. Fixed all dates from 2024 to 2025-2026
7. Created this context file for session continuity

**Key Decisions Made**:
- Python for Week 1-5 (AI/ML work)
- TypeScript for Week 6 (MCP servers)
- Build from scratch before using frameworks
- Weekly blog posts + daily social media
- Portfolio website as final deliverable

**Ankur's Concerns Addressed**:
- Session continuity: This file + daily logs ensure context preservation
- Can safely exit and resume - just read this file first
- All important info is in files, not just conversation history

## For Claude (or any AI Assistant) Reading This

When Ankur returns, please:

1. **Read this CONTEXT.md file** to understand the full picture
2. **Check the "Current Status" section** to see where he is
3. **Read the relevant daily-log.md** to see what he did last
4. **Reference PLAN.md** for the detailed weekly curriculum
5. **Check PROGRESS.md** for overall completion status

Then greet him with:
- A summary of where he left off
- What he should work on next
- Offer to help with the current task

Remember:
- Ankur wants to learn by doing, so help scaffold but let him code
- He values understanding the "why" and "how it fits together"
- Weekly shipping is important - keep him focused
- This is a portfolio project - quality matters
- Be encouraging but honest about technical trade-offs

**Your role**: Technical mentor, pair programmer, and accountability partner for this 8-week journey.
