# Context for AI Assistant

## About Ankur

**Role**: Director of Engineering
**Coding Experience**: Strong software engineering background, but hasn't coded hands-on for ~2 years
**Current State**: Close to tech, reviews code with developers, understands systems thinking, but wants to get back to shipping code personally

**Learning Style**:
- Prefers to build world view first, then go deep
- Thrives on understanding the big picture before diving into details
- Learns best by building and shipping real projects

## What Ankur Wants to Achieve

### Primary Goal
**Get back to hands-on coding and start shipping projects end-to-end over the next 8 weeks**

### Specific Objectives
1. **Learn AI Engineering Path**: Vector databases, RAG, MCP, autonomous agents, non-deterministic systems
2. **Build Portfolio-Worthy Projects**: Each project should tell a story and demonstrate mastery
3. **Ship Weekly**: Real, production-ready projects, not just tutorials
4. **Create Content**: Blog posts, videos, portfolio website to showcase the journey
5. **Learn Modern AI Stack**: Embeddings, vector search, LLMs, agent frameworks, MCP servers

### Technology Preferences
- **Languages**: JavaScript and Python (comfortable with both)
- **AI Stack**: Vector DBs, RAG, MCP, agent systems
- **Tools**: Using Claude Code for development assistance
- **Approach**: Build from scratch first to understand, then use frameworks for comparison

## The Plan We Created

## How to Understand Progress

### Priority Order for Reading (When Resuming)
1. **CONTEXT.md** (this file) - Understand who Ankur is and what he's doing
2. **CURRENT_STATUS section below** - Where is he right now?
3. **week-XX/notes/daily-log.md** - What did he do most recently?
4. **PROGRESS.md** - Overall completion status
5. **week-XX/README.md** - Current week's detailed plan

### Progress Indicators
- **PROGRESS.md**: High-level weekly completion status, skills acquired, reflections
- **daily-log.md**: Granular daily updates - what was done, learned, challenges faced
- **Git commits**: Check `git log` for recent activity
- **Project folders**: Check `week-XX/project/` for actual code

### How Ankur Uses Claude Code
- **Scaffolding & Setup**: Claude helps with boilerplate and project setup
- **Debugging & Review**: Claude reviews code for best practices
- **Learning**: Claude explains concepts before Ankur implements
- **Testing & Docs**: Claude generates tests and documentation
- **BUT**: Ankur writes the core logic himself to learn deeply

## Key Principles for This Journey

### 1. Ship, Don't Perfect
- Focus on completing and shipping over perfection
- MVP first, iterate later
- Weekly deadlines are important

### 2. Build to Learn
- Don't just read tutorials - build real projects
- Understand fundamentals before using frameworks
- Write from scratch first, then compare with frameworks

### 3. Document Everything
- Daily logs capture learnings and challenges
- Blog posts force deep understanding
- Portfolio tells the complete story

### 4. World View First
- Week 1 starts with 2 days of reading and mental model building
- Understand the "why" and "how it fits together" before coding
- Create mental maps and diagrams

### 5. Portfolio-Worthy Output
- Each project should be production-ready
- Code is clean, tested, and well-documented
- Projects tell a coherent story: "From Director to AI Engineer"

## Important Context from Our Conversation

### Week 1 is Aggressive
- Ankur is on holiday, so Week 1 has 40-50 hour commitment
- This is the foundation week - crucial to get it right
- Focus: Understanding AI stack + shipping semantic code search tool

### Dates Were Fixed
- Originally had 2024 dates, corrected to 2025-2026
- Start: December 28, 2025 (Saturday)
- End: February 22, 2026

### The Story Arc Matters
**"From Engineering Leader to AI Practitioner: 8 Weeks of Building"**
- This isn't just learning - it's a career portfolio project
- Content creation is as important as the code
- Each week builds on the previous one

### Technologies He'll Learn
- **Vector DBs**: ChromaDB → Qdrant → Pinecone (progression)
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI, semantic search, similarity
- **RAG**: From scratch, then advanced patterns
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol servers
- **Agents**: ReAct pattern, tool calling, memory
- **Full Stack**: Next.js, FastAPI, deployment

     - Connected to Day 1 learning: RNN insights manifest in transformer math

   - **Checkpoint 2**: Post-Training - From Base Model to Assistant (detailed)
     - KEY INSIGHT: Base model is "internet document simulator" → Post-training transforms to "helpful assistant"
     - Human labeling and InstructGPT paper (2022) revelation
     - Three phases: conversation tokenization → human labeling → synthetic data evolution
     - The "psychology" of ChatGPT: statistical simulation of helpful labelers
     - Concrete examples showing base model vs. instruct model behavior
     - Revolutionary discovery: quality labeling matters more than quantity
     - Modern trend: LLM-assisted labeling and synthetic data (2023-2025)

   - **Created running notes file** (`day2-deep-dive-notes.md`) with 400+ lines of structured notes
   - **All resource links captured**: Tiktokenizer, visualizers, papers, tools

### Still to Watch:
- [ ] Inference optimization
- [ ] Scaling laws
- [ ] Context window limitations
- [ ] RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
- [ ] Practical applications and deployment

### Still to Complete Today:
- [ ] Jay Alammar's Illustrated Word2Vec (with Deep Dive context)
- [ ] Weaviate: Vector Embeddings Explained
- [ ] Pinecone: Vector Database
- [ ] Create mental model diagram in `week-01/notes/mental-model.md`

## What's Been Completed (Overall)

3. Design system architecture for semantic-code-search project

## Quick Navigation
- [Master Plan](PLAN.md) - Complete 8-week curriculum
- [Week 1 Plan](week-01/README.md) - Detailed week plan
- [Daily Log](week-01/notes/daily-log.md) - Daily updates
- [Progress Tracker](PROGRESS.md) - Overall progress
- [Resources](resources/README.md) - Learning materials

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Ankur is using Claude Code as his development partner
- All code goes in `week-XX/project/` folders
- Update this CONTEXT.md at end of each day/session
- Blog posts go in `portfolio/blog-posts/`
- Daily logs are critical for continuity

## Latest Session Summary (Dec 29, 2025)
**What We Accomplished Today**:
1. ✅ Completed Claude Code tutorial - learned all basic commands and specialized agents
2. ✅ Chose "Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT" over simpler intro video
3. ✅ Captured 2 major checkpoints (400+ lines of detailed notes)
4. ✅ Created running notes structure: detailed notes during learning, summary in daily-log at end of day
5. ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive agent documentation
6. ✅ Made 4 commits to GitHub with progress

**Key Learnings Captured**:
- **Checkpoint 1 - Pretraining**: Complete flow from text → tokens → 12-layer transformer → 1.6B parameters
  - Tokenization strategy matters (BPE algorithm)
  - Softmax brilliance: converts raw scores to interpretable probabilities
  - Day 1 insights (RNNs, LSTMs, attention) manifest directly in transformer architecture

- **Checkpoint 2 - Post-Training**: The real magic isn't in pretraining, it's in post-training
  - Base model = "internet document simulator"
  - Post-training = teaches model to "think like helpful human labeler"
  - InstructGPT paper (2022) was the breakthrough: quality labeling > quantity
  - Modern evolution: synthetic data with LLM assistance (2023-2025)
  - Concrete examples: why ChatGPT refuses harmful requests while base model would comply

**Approach Decision Made**:
- Running notes strategy: detailed checkpoint notes during video/learning
- End-of-day summary in daily-log.md for continuity
- All resource links captured for future reference

**Remaining for Day 2**:
- Continue watching Deep Dive (inference, scaling, RLHF, applications)
- Read: Jay Alammar, Weaviate, Pinecone (with better context from Deep Dive)
- Create mental model diagram
- Daily-log summary

**Key Decisions Made** (Previous Sessions):
- Python for Week 1-5 (AI/ML work)
- TypeScript for Week 6 (MCP servers)
- Build from scratch before using frameworks
- Weekly blog posts + daily social media
- Portfolio website as final deliverable

**Ankur's Learning Style Validated**:
- World view first, then deep dive ✅ (went deep on transformers before moving on)
- Learning by asking questions ✅ (rabbit holes are learning, not distraction)
- Wants understanding before code ✅ (building mental models before Day 3 hands-on)
